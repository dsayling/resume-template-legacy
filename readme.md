## jsonresume simple template

Made with http://jsonresume.org and [this action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jsonresume-export)

Hosts with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) since it's easy.

* just fork this repo
* rename to username.github.io
* clone, edit and push!


## Guide

[check out the action docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jsonresume-export) for template instructions

I simplified the workflow and sepearated the gh-pages branch from main so you dont have to prevent the forever loop.


## Origins

- Originally forked from https://github.com/BretFisher/resume
- Built the container myself using travis and then github
- Eventually the CI wasn't working with older npm packages
- Discovered jsonresume action that was created and simplified.
